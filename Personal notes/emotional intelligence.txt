Emotional Intelligence (EQ) means being good at understanding and managing emotions, both your own and others'. It involves skills like empathy, self-awareness, and handling social situations well.

Unlike Intelligence Quotient (IQ), which measures logical and problem-solving abilities, EQ is more about how you handle emotions and social situations.

EQ is important because it helps in building good relationships, being a better leader, adapting to changes, dealing with stress, resolving conflicts, and making wise decisions. It's like having a set of skills that make you more effective in dealing with people and situations in your life.
