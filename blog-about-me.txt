1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.


I faced a significant ethical decision when choosing to move to New Zealand. Raised in a close-knit family that prioritized caring for each other and maintaining close ties with grandparents, I grappled with the desire to follow my dreams and lead a better life.

Thinking about family closeness and my own dreams, I had to decide what mattered most. After thinking a lot and talking honestly with my family, I chose to move. I wanted to grow personally and find new opportunities.

Looking back, I see it was hard to balance family expectations with my own goals. Even though it was tough, choosing to move was like finding a middle ground â€“ I still care about family, but I also wanted to follow my dreams.

2.
Being Czech and European has had a big impact on who I am. My parents, who work hard and are good people, taught me important things. They showed me the value of being moral and working hard.

My partner is also a big influence. He's always learning and staying positive, which inspires me. Our culture puts a lot of importance on education and self-improvement, and that has shaped me too.

So, growing up in this environment has made me value hard work, integrity, and always trying to be better. These things are a big part of who I am.


3.
When I transitioned into the role of an innovator at the education center, I encountered resistance from colleagues who were older and had more experience. My enthusiasm for modern technologies and new teaching approaches sometimes clashed with their established ways.

At first, I approached the changes with eagerness, introducing new methods and ideas.
However, I faced resistance, with some colleagues being defensive and unwilling to embrace change. In hindsight, I realize that I might have been a bit too forceful in my approach.

I attempted to work productively by making changes swiftly, assuming it would be efficient. Looking back, I understand that involving them in the process, seeking their opinions, and implementing changes gradually might have been more effective. I've learned the importance of collaboration and understanding differing perspectives. If faced with a similar situation now, I would prioritize open communication, involve team members in decision-making, and take a more gradual approach to change, ensuring everyone feels heard and valued in the process. This would likely foster a more positive and receptive atmosphere for implementing innovations.
