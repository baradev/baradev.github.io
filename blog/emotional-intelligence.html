              Emotional Intelligence (EQ) means being good at understanding and
              managing emotions, both your own and others'. It involves skills
              like empathy, self-awareness, and handling social situations well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike Intelligence Quotient (IQ), which measures logical and
              problem-solving abilities, EQ is more about how you handle
              emotions and social situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              EQ is important because it helps in building good relationships,
              being a better leader, adapting to changes, dealing with stress,
              resolving conflicts, and making wise decisions. It's like having a
              set of skills that make you more effective in dealing with people
              and situations in your life.
