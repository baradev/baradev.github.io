          Emotional Intelligence (EQ) means being good at understanding and
          managing emotions, both your own and others'. It involves skills like
          empathy, self-awareness, and handling social situations well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike Intelligence Quotient (IQ), which measures logical and
          problem-solving abilities, EQ is more about how you handle emotions
          and social situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          EQ is important because it helps in building good relationships, being
          a better leader, adapting to changes, dealing with stress, resolving
          conflicts, and making wise decisions. It's like having a set of skills
          that make you more effective in dealing with people and situations in
          your life.
