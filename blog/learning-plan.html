            <h3>1. Long-Term Goal</h3>
            <p>
              My long-term goal is to become a confident and skilled coder,
              ultimately securing a job in the tech field.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Strengths and Limitations</h3>
            <p>
              I am dedicated to learning, demonstrating commitment and
              perseverance when pursuing my goals. Once I decide on a course of
              action, I stay focused and dedicated.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the limitations note, when I fail, I easily lose motivation,
              and it takes me a while to get over it.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Personal Development Goals</h3>
            <p>
              I would like to develop more habits, communication confidence -
              enhance my ability to express ideas clearly and confidently. Learn
              effective collaboration within a team, understanding roles and
              responsibilities. Develop strong time management skills to handle
              workload efficiently.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h3>4. Workload Management and Coping with Pressure</h3>
            <p>
              I will proactively communicate with team members, facilitators,
              and industry representatives. I will regularly assess progress and
              adjust schedules as needed to meet deadlines. I will prioritize
              tasks based on urgency and importance.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will regularly practice mindfulness techniques to manage stress.
              I will take short breaks to refresh when feeling overwhelmed. I
              will utilize support networks, such as peers and mentors, for
              guidance.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>5. Seeking Help</h3>
            <p>
              I will promptly reach out to facilitators or mentors when facing
              challenges. I will engage in peer-to-peer learning, forming study
              groups to share insights. I will attend scheduled support sessions
              and workshops.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h3>6. Expectations from the Facilitation Team</h3>
            <p>
              I expect clear communication of expectations and learning
              objectives. I seek constructive feedback and guidance on both
              technical and non-technical aspects. I anticipate availability for
              one-on-one discussions and support when needed.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Communication and Commitments</h3>
            <p>
              I will communicate in advance if any unforeseen commitments arise.
              While fully committed to dedicating the majority of my time to
              study, I acknowledge the potential for unexpected family
              commitments. During the foundation period, I plan to handle school
              drop-offs (8:30 to 9:00 am) and pick-ups (2:30 to 3:00 pm),
              assuring you that I am committed to managing these
              responsibilities efficiently to ensure minimal impact on my
              learning journey.
