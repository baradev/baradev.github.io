        <h2>1. Long-Term Goal</h2>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to become a confident and skilled coder,
          ultimately securing a job in the tech field.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Strengths and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          I am dedicated to learning, demonstrating commitment and perseverance
          when pursuing my goals. Once I decide on a course of action, I stay
          focused and dedicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the limitations note, when I fail, I easily lose motivation, and it
          takes me a while to get over it.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Personal Development Goals</h2>
        <p>
          I would like to develop more habits, communication confidence -
          enhance my ability to express ideas clearly and confidently. Learn
          effective collaboration within a team, understanding roles and
          responsibilities. Develop strong time management skills to handle
          workload efficiently.

      <section>
        <h2>4. Workload Management and Coping with Pressure</h2>
        <p>
          I will proactively communicate with team members, facilitators, and
          industry representatives. I will regularly assess progress and adjust
          schedules as needed to meet deadlines. I will prioritize tasks based
          on urgency and importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will regularly practice mindfulness techniques to manage stress. I
          will take short breaks to refresh when feeling overwhelmed. I will
          utilize support networks, such as peers and mentors, for guidance.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Seeking Help</h2>
        <p>
          I will promptly reach out to facilitators or mentors when facing
          challenges. I will engage in peer-to-peer learning, forming study
          groups to share insights. I will attend scheduled support sessions and
          workshops.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Expectations from the Facilitation Team</h2>
        <p>
          I expect clear communication of expectations and learning objectives.
          I seek constructive feedback and guidance on both technical and
          non-technical aspects. I anticipate availability for one-on-one
          discussions and support when needed.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Communication and Commitments</h2>
        <p>
          I will communicate in advance if any unforeseen commitments arise.
          While fully committed to dedicating the majority of my time to study,
          I acknowledge the potential for unexpected family commitments. During
          the foundation period, I plan to handle school drop-offs (8:30 to 9:00
          am) and pick-ups (2:30 to 3:00 pm), assuring you that I am committed
          to managing these responsibilities efficiently to ensure minimal
          impact on my learning journey.
